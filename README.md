# **Rock, Paper, Scissors!**

This is a repository for the first game I ever made in JavaScript: Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Currently, the languages used are regular, good old HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I built the prototype of this game in my second day-long hackathon at the **[School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)** bootcamp.

The player chooses their move onscreen, and through DOM interaction and manipulation, fires events that randomise the computer's return move. The player can also input their username, and on blurring focus, the input box becomes part of the header.

## **Roadmap**

As this game was built with the intention of practicing pair programming and getting more familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I have continued editing it in order to pursue these aims further.

I have added dark mode functionality, and would like to edit the styling on the button more. I would also like to add some small transitional ease-in-ease-out animations to various functions, and maybe some delays or animations to the computer moves' display area. I would also like to edit the styling on the username input box to be sleeker.
